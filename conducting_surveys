# 4. Conducting Surveys

Some of the projects involve conducting surveys. This section aims to outline the general process of conducting surveys. The most important thing to keep in mind is that each survey is unique. This means that while there is a general process, each step should be analyzed and evaluated within the context of each survey. To make it easier to identify parts of the process, you can divide it into three main parts: pre-fieldwork, during fieldwork and post-fieldwork.

## i. Pre-fieldwork

### 1. Designing the survey
### 2. Programming the survey in SurveyCTO
### 3. IRB
### 4. Piloting the survey
### 5. Hiring of field team 

## ii. During fieldwork 

### 6. Data collection team composition
### 7. Quality checks
To ensure that high-quality data is being produced, we must monitor data collection to detect programming errors, surveyor errors, data fabrication, poorly understood questions, and other issues. The two useful tools you must work with to monitor are the **survey tracker** and **back checks**.

#### **Survey Tracker**
It is highly recommended to create a survey tracker on Google Sheets. [SurveyCTO has a functionality](https://docs.surveycto.com/05-exporting-and-publishing-data/03-publishing-data-to-the-cloud/02.forms-to-google-sheets.html#:~:text=To%20configure%20any%20one%20of,Sheets%20and%20Google%20Drive%20accounts.) where you can connect your selected data to a spreadsheet in real time. 
With it, you will keep track of: 

1. how many responses you obtain daily and the last seven days, 
2. what is the status of each survey, 
3. the distance to the goal at target level, 
4. the average duration of the survey and its main sections, 
5. the productivity of each surveyor. 


Examples where the tracker is useful: 

* You observe that you’re not reaching the goal in a geographic area or group and time is running out. 
    + With survey statuses, you could plan revisiting eligible respondents, for example those who didn’t fully reject to participate.
* You observe that a certain surveyor has a survey duration time above the mean or a low response rate.
    + Above all, creating the tracker would help to identify this situation promptly. Once you have identified it, you could do back checks (audits) to identify challenges that the surveyor is facing, plan a strategy to improve, and give useful feedback to do it better. 

#### **Back checks**

[Data quality checks](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/resource/data-quality-checks) are important to identify the reliability of the data collected, specifically back checks. We will choose the way in which we want to corroborate that collected responses are reliable depending on survey logistics, budget, respondent availability, respondent fatigue, among others. We could re-interview respondents with a shorter form based on the original, but with fewer questions, or audit the audios of the interviews generated by surveyCTO.  

##### Option 1: Re-interviewing 
The questions to be included in this survey must be selected strategically. You should ask the most important questions you want to confirm. We don’t want to fatigue respondents. The team that would perform back check interviews should not be the same team conducting the original survey; you may have to hire and train additional staff. As such, back-checking surveys can carry a high cost. One money-saving alternative can be to record telephone numbers of respondents so that surveyors can call respondents instead of traveling to their locations. [Visit J-Pal’s research resources](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/resource/data-quality-checks) for more information on this.

##### Option 2: Audits
The questions to be included in an audit survey could be all in the original survey. 
The team that would perform audits will listen to the audios and fill out a survey specifically for audits. Remember that people without Human Subjects certification can access a maximum of 20% of all data with PII. 
We recommend adding time stamps for the most important questions, or those you want to observe closely, for any reason. Once you collect responses, you could:

* Compare the original data to the audit data and observe if there are any differences
* Monitor surveyors performance
* Identify issues during data collection that can’t be identified through the survey tracker, such as a poor introductory speech, questions that were not properly asked, or surveyors not making sure they are surveying the right person.

### 8. Documenting mistakes
### 9. High Frequency Checks (HFC)


##### Open-ended and multiple-choice with other option questions
Adding relevant answer choices promptly could significantly reduce fieldwork and data cleaning efforts. HFCs provide an easy way to observe responses to these types of questions. All you need to do is run them. You should monitor these responses periodically (at least weekly) and count the number of times they are repeated to propose new answer choices if eligible. 
For these responses to be eligible as new answer choices, these should appear in (at least) a set percentage of the sample size. The principal investigator must approve the minimum percentage and new options. 
Example for a minimum percentage of 5% and a sample size of 1000 surveys: to propose a repeated response as a new answer choice, it should have been observed in at least 50 surveys.
