# *Guidelines for Research Assistants*

## ii. Managing project tasks with Asana.
We use [Asana](https://asana.com/) to keep track of project tasks, provide updates and follow up on meetings. Before setting up Asana, read the [product guide](https://asana.com/guide/help) and [common questions](https://asana.com/guide/help/faq/common-questions) to understand how Asana works. In the rest of this section, I will refer to our projects/papers (for example, an analysis of a financial inclusion experiment) as *Projects*, and the subcomponents/sections of Asana teams and workspaces as *projects*.

### Setting up new Projects
1. First, download and install [Asana](https://asana.com/). For Asana to function correctly, you must register with your @kellog.northwestern.edu email, which will grant you access to the Kellogg organization on Asana. 
2. Create a new team by clicking on **Add Team** in the left panel. We will have one team per Project, and if you're working on more than one Project, you will be able to see all the teams in the same window.

2. Write down the name of the Project (preferrably one or two words) and a short description. You can start inviting members at this point, but you will have to add them to each Asana project once they are created.

3. The next step is to create Asana projects, which will be sections of our Project. For example, we will always have an Admin and Analysis section in our Projects, and these sections are what Asana defines as projects. 
    1. Click on **Create a Project** below the selected team.

    2. Select **Blank project** for project setup.

    3. Define the section's name (e.g. "Admin"), choosee **Board** as the default view, and leave privacy settings as **Public to team**. Click continue to finalize creating this project.

    4. Click on **Start adding tasks** and **Go to project**.

    5. By default, the project will have three categories: To do, In progress, and Complete. Add a third category called "Archive".

    6. Once you have set up an initial project, click on the three dots next to the project name and select **Duplicate Project**. Duplicate the project to generate a section called Admin, a second one called Agenda, and a third one called Analysis. These three sections will be the base of the Project. More details are explained in the following part of the guide.

    7. For each duplicated project, click on the down arrow next to the project name, and change the project's name so that it is easily identifiable.

    8. Here is an example of how the sections of a Project look like:
