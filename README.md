# *Guidelines for Research Assistants*

## ii. Managing project tasks with Asana.
We use [Asana](https://asana.com/) to keep track of project tasks, provide updates and follow up on meetings. Before setting up Asana, read the [product guide](https://asana.com/guide/help) and [common questions](https://asana.com/guide/help/faq/common-questions) to understand how Asana works. 
In the rest of this section, I will refer to academic projects (for example, an analysis of a financial inclusion experiment) as *Projects*, and the subcomponents/sections of Asana teams and workspaces as *projects*.

### Setting up new Projects
1. First, download and install [Asana](https://asana.com/). For Asana to function correctly, you must register with your @kellog.northwestern.edu email, which will grant you access to the Kellogg organization on Asana. 
2. Create a new team by clicking on **Add Team** in the left panel. We will have one team per Project, and if you're working on more than one Project, you will be able to see all the teams in the same window.

2. Write down the name of the Project (preferrably one or two words) and a short description. You can start inviting members at this point, but you will have to add them to each Asana project once they are created.

3. The next step is to create Asana projects, which will be sections of our Project. For example, we will always have an Admin and Analysis section in our Projects, and these sections are what Asana defines as projects. 
    1. Click on **Create a Project** below the selected team.

        <img src="https://github.com/clandinq/ra_guide/blob/main/pictures/asana/asana_setup_3.png" align="center" height="30%" width="30%">
        
    2. Select **Blank project** for project setup.
    
        <img src="https://github.com/clandinq/ra_guide/blob/main/pictures/asana/asana_setup_4.png" align="center" height="40%" width="40%">
    
    3. Define the section's name (e.g. "Admin"), choosee **Board** as the default view, and leave privacy settings as **Public to team**. Click continue to finalize creating this project. If you forget to set this up when creating the project, you can configure Board as the default view in the project settings.

    4. Click on **Start adding tasks** and **Go to project**.
        
        <img src="https://github.com/clandinq/ra_guide/blob/main/pictures/asana/asana_setup_7.png" align="center" height="30%" width="30%">
        
    5. By default, the project will have three columns: To do, In progress, and Complete. Add a fourth column called "Archive".
        
        <img src="https://github.com/clandinq/ra_guide/blob/main/pictures/asana/asana_setup_8.png" align="center" height="50%" width="50%">
        
    6. Once you have set up an initial project, click on the three dots next to the project name and select **Duplicate Project**. Duplicate the project to generate a section called Admin, a second one called Agenda, and a third one called Analysis. These three sections will be the base of the Project. More details are explained in the [following part of the guide](https://github.com/clandinq/ra_guide/#using-sections-to-keep-track-of-different-types-of-tasks).

        <img src="https://github.com/clandinq/ra_guide/blob/main/pictures/asana/asana_setup_9.png" align="center" height="40%" width="40%">
        
    7. For each duplicated project, click on the down arrow next to the project name, and change the project's name so that it is easily identifiable.
    
        <img src="https://github.com/clandinq/ra_guide/blob/main/pictures/asana/asana_setup_11.png" align="center" height="40%" width="40%">
        
    8. Here is an example of how the sections of a Project looks like:
        
        <img src="https://github.com/clandinq/ra_guide/blob/main/pictures/asana/asana_setup_12.png" align="center" height="25%" width="25%">        
        
    9. Once all projects have been set up, invite all researchers and RAs as collaborators to the team. You can invite new members to a maximum of three projects. Once they have accepted your invitation, you can invite them to join the rest of the projects. You can see who is a member of each project on the left of the search bar:

### Using sections, columns, tasks and subtasks to keep track of work
#### Sections
Keep different types of tasks in separate sections. Most projects will have the following sections:
- **Admin**: This section should contain administrative tasks. For example, writing up presentation comments and organizing tasks in Asana.
- **Agenda**: Keep items to be discussed in meetings in this section. Also, there should be a category (column) titled "Priorities" with the priorities of all the team members. This is explained more in detail in the [following sections](https://github.com/clandinq/ra_guide/#keeping-track-of-agenda-contents).
- **Analysis**: All analysis-related tasks will be in this section. This should be the center of any project.
- **Presentations**: Tasks for presentations and conferences.
- **References**: Relevant references to keep in mind when writing the paper.
- **Comments**: Presentation comments. More details in the following sections.

Other sections projects can have include:
- Budget
- Grant deliverables
- Surveys

Feel free to set up new sections if necessary.

#### Columns
Most sections should have the following columns:
- **To do**: Tasks that have not been started yet.
- **In progress**: Tasks you are currently working on.
- **Complete**: Recently completed tasks.
- **Archive**: Completed tasks that have been discussed with researchers and whose output has been acknowledged. 

When completing a task, move it to the **Complete** column and add the task to the **Agenda** section to ensure it gets discussed in the next meeting with PIs. Once it has been acknowledged, and if there are no more follow-up tasks that will be assigned to the same item, you can mark it as complete by clicking the check mark button and moving it to **Archive**.

#### Tasks and subtasks
All the work you do can be added as tasks and subtasks. The following is an example of a couple of tasks in Asana:

<img src="https://github.com/clandinq/ra_guide/blob/main/pictures/asana/task.png" align="center" height="25%" width="25%">

Lengthier tasks should be broken down into subtasks:

<img src="https://github.com/clandinq/ra_guide/blob/main/pictures/asana/subtask.png" align="center" height="40%" width="40%">


Here are some guidelines for tasks
Tasks should have clear, short names that makes it easy to identify them. You can write down a full breakdown of the required task in the description section of the task. When creating tasks, assign them to the main person responsible for completing the task, and assign a deadline. They are generally not hard deadlines, but can help to prioritize and identify tasks that have dragged on for longer than necessary. For tasks assigned to you, if the person creating the task did not put a deadline, set your own deadline to give the researchers a sense of when you think the task will be completed by.
ubtasks can also have deadlines assigned to them.

### Tracking priorities in the admin section
The first column in the **Admin** section should be called "Priorities", and will include a task for each team member with their priorities:

<img src="https://github.com/clandinq/ra_guide/blob/main/pictures/asana/priorities_1.png" align="center" height="25%" width="25%">     

Include as subtasks current tasks by order of priority, with the most important tasks first. Delete subtasks when completed. This is so that it's easier to keep track of current tasks (since most of the time there will be several tasks assigned to you), and that PIs can know what your curent priorities are. **Always keep this section up to date**.

### Keeping track of agenda contents
The agenda section is used to keep track of current priorities and items to be discussed in each meeting. Start by creating a column for each regular meeting:

<img src="https://github.com/clandinq/ra_guide/blob/main/pictures/asana/agenda_0.png" align="center" height="50%" width="50%">     

Follow these steps to add tasks to the agenda:
1. Click on a task that you want to add to a meeting agenda.

    <img src="https://github.com/clandinq/ra_guide/blob/main/pictures/asana/agenda_1.png" align="center" height="25%" width="25%"> 
    
2. Click on **Add to projects** and select **Agenda**.

    <img src="https://github.com/clandinq/ra_guide/blob/main/pictures/asana/agenda_2.png" align="center" height="30%" width="30%"> 
  
3. Select the meeting to add the task to.

    <img src="https://github.com/clandinq/ra_guide/blob/main/pictures/asana/agenda_3.png" align="center" height="30%" width="30%"> 

4. The other section's color will display in the selected task. For example, this task is in the section **Analysis** and the Admin's section pink color is drawn over the task.
